1. Find the total revenue generated in the year 2024, grouped by month, sorted from January to December.
You have a table orders(order_id, customer_id, amount, order_date).
1. select month(order_date) as month_number, sum(amount) as total_revenue from orders
where year(order_date)  = 2024
group by month(order_date) order by month(order_date)

customers(customer_id, name, city)
orders(order_id, customer_id, amount)
2. List the top 3 cities that generated the highest total revenue, along with the revenue amount.
2. select customers.city, sum(orders.amount) as total_revenue from customers join orders
on customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
group by customers.city order by total_revenue desc
limit 3

3. Running Total per Customer
Table: orders(order_id, customer_id, amount, order_date)
For each customer, calculate a running total of their spending ordered by date.

3. with cte1 as (select customer_id, order_id, order_date, amount, sum(amount) over (partition by customer_id order by order_date)
from orders) as running_total
select cte1.customer_id, cte1.order_id, cte1.order_date, cte1.amount, cte1.running_total from cte1
order by cte1.customer_id, cte1.order_date

4. Return the employee(s) who have the 2nd highest salary within each department.
employees(emp_id, name, dept, salary)
4. with cte1 as (select emp_id, name, dept, salary, dense_rank() over (partition by department order by salary desc) as rnk
from employees)
select cte1.emp_id, cte1.name,cte1.dept, cte1.salary from cte1
where cte1.rnk  = 2

5. For each customer, return the order with the highest amount, 
with cte1 as (Select customer_id, order_id, amount, dense_rank() over (partition by customer_id order by amount desc) as rnk
from orders)
select cte1.customer_id, cte1.order_id, cte1.amount from cte1 
where cte1.rnk =  1
order by cte1.amount desc

6. logins(user_id, login_date)
Task:
For each month in 2024, calculate the retention rate, defined as:
% of users who logged in this month AND also logged in the previous month.

with cte1 as (select user_id, month(login_date) as mn from logins where year(login_date) = 2024
group by user_id, month(login_date)),
cte2 as (select user_id, mn, lag(mn) over(partition by user_id order by mn) as prev_month from cte1),
cte3 as (select mn, count(distinct user_id) as active_users, count(distinct case when prev_month is  not null then user_id) as retained_users
from cte2 group by mn
select mn, active_users, retained_users, (retained_users / active_users)*100.0 as retention_percentage from cte3
order by mn
